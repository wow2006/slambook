\section*{ Exercises}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item verifies that the rotation matrix is an orthogonal matrix.
	\item (optional) find the derivation process of Rodrigues formula and understand it.
	\item verifies that after the quaternion rotates a point, the result is a virtual quaternion (the real part is zero), so it still corresponds to a three-dimensional space point, see \eqref{eq:rotate-with-quaternion}.
	The \item drawing table summarizes the conversion relationship of the rotation matrix, the axis angle, the Euler angle, and the quaternion.
	\item Suppose there is a large Eigen matrix, its top left corner wants $3 \times 3$ blocks taken out, and then assigned to $\bm{I}_{3 \times 3}$ . Please programmatically implement.
	\item (optional) General linear equation $\bm{A} \bm{x}=\bm{b}$ What are the practices? Can you implement it in Eigen?
\end{enumerate}
