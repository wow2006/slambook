\section*{ Exercises}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item (optional) Look for a camera (the camera of your phone or laptop) and calibrate its internal parameters. You may use the calibration board or print a checkerboard for calibration yourself.
	\item describes the physical meaning of the camera's internal parameters. If the resolution of a camera is doubled and the rest is the same, how does its internal parameter change?
	\item Searches for the calibration method of a special camera (fisheye or panoramic camera). What are the different \mbox{ different from the normal pinhole model? }
	\item investigates the similarities and differences between a global shutter and a rolling shutter. What are their advantages and disadvantages in SLAM?
	How is the \item RGB-D camera calibrated? Taking Kinect as an example, what parameters need to be calibrated? (See \url{https://github.com/code-iai/iai_kinect2}.)
	\item In addition to the way the sample program demonstrates traversing images, what other ways to traverse images?
	\item (optional) Read the official OpenCV tutorial and learn its basic usage.
