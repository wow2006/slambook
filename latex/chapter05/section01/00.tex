\section{camera model}
The process of mapping a coordinate point (in meters) in a three-dimensional world to a two-dimensional image plane (in pixels) can be described by a geometric model. There are many models of this model, the simplest of which is called \textbf{pinhole model}. The pinhole model is a very common and effective model that describes the relationship between the projection of a beam of light through the pinhole and the projection on the back of the pinhole. In this book we use a simple pinhole camera model to model this mapping. At the same time, due to the presence of the lens on the camera lens, \textbf{distortion} is generated during the projection of the light onto the imaging plane. Therefore, we use two models of pinhole and distortion to describe the entire projection process.

In this section, the pinhole model of the camera is given first, and then the distortion model of the lens is explained. These two models are capable of projecting external 3D points onto the camera's internal imaging plane to form the camera's \textbf{intrainsics}.
